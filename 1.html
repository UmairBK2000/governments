			<p class="intro"> A government is a system in which a group of people/one person controls the nation. There are several forms of governments. In this article, I talk about democracy.

				<p class="intro">A democracy is a form of government in which the people rule the nation.The word 'democracy' comes from 'demo' meaning 'people' and 'kratos' meaning 'power'. This can literally be translated to 'people power'. 
					<br>
				<h4>How Democracy Started</h4>
A form of a democratic government started in Athens, Greece. The government preceding this was an oligarchy. Only the rich could be part of this. The poor were in debt, and had to sell their family members to repay their loans. In the marketplace, not only was there buying and selling but also stories of broken families. The poor wanted a change. They were one big army and could easily overthrow the oligarchy. The wealthy knew they were outnumbered. So they turned to a man named Solon for help. First, Solon changed government and society. He divided citizens into four classes. This classed society was based on how much food your farms produced. The first 3 classes could particapate in government affairs. Then, Solon changed debtor laws. You couldn't sell family into slavery anymore. Not everyone liked this government. The rich didn't like sharing power. The fourth class also disliked this. A few decades later, a wealthy man named Pesistraus sent an army to take over Athens. This tyrant decreased the poor's rights. When he died, his son Hippias took over. By now, the citizens assembled an army to overthrow this monarchy. After they got victory, they turned to a man named Cleisthenes, who helped defeat Hippias, to make a gdovernment. Cleisthenes wanted a government run by the people. He found a group called an Assembly. The Assembly was a lawmaking body of Athens. Every single citizen had a vote there. No laws were approved without the Assembly's approval.
				
				
				<h4> Democracy Now</h4>
				About two and a half millenia later, in Colonial America, the colonists had won the Revolutionary War. America needed a government plan. So in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, delegates of the states gathered for a plan. They had studied Solon, Cleisthenes, and Ancient Greek Government. Democracy developed when the Ancients asked, 'Who should lead a society?'. The answer was the first 3 words of the US Constitution: We the people.
